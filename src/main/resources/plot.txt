FATE
1st mission - Intro
* Player spawns with ghost floating in front of him
Ghost: You're alive! I spent months trying to find someone compatible. Hurry up, they are coming, we can't stay here.
* Ghost despawns
* Player follows the path until they find a door with an item close to it
* Ghost spawns
Ghost: Hey, check that gun while I try to open this door.
* Player unlocks auto rifle and the door opens, Ghost despawns they walk a bit more until they find some Fallen
Ghost: Well, you've met the Fallen. They aren't very happy to see you
* Player combats Fallen until they find another item
Ghost: Guardian, I think I see a shotgun over there!
 * Player unlocks shotgun, level continues (miniboss).
Ghost: I think you got them all, at least for now. I found a ship a few weeks ago, it's just up ahead
* Level ends, player is taken to the tower.

1st tower visit
* Player and ghost spawn on the tower
Ghost: This is the tower, an overwatch for Earth's Last City. Look, it's Commander Zavala! Let's talk to him
* Player walks up to Zavala
Zavala: Oh, hello Guardian! I see you are fresh out of the grave. These are hard times indeed, let me explain.
A few centuries ago, humanity found the Traveler, an alien orb capable of unthinkable power and knowledge.
With its help, we terraformed dozens of worlds and achieved high level technology, it was a true Golden Age.
But the Traveler had its enemy, the Darkness, that followed him to our own home: Earth!
As last resort, the Traveler sacrificed itself to dispel the Darkness, entering a deep dormant state.
As its last breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts, capable of giving the power of the Light to those who are worth it.
As your first mission, I need you to attack a possible whereabouts of the mighty Sepiks Prime.
Your ghost will provide you intel and keep our communications up. Eyes up, guardian!
* Level ends and player is loaded to the second mission

2nd mission - Sepiks Prime
* Player spawns on Earth, there is a door in front of him, so he walks towards it
Ghost: So, Sepiks Prime is an Archon, these are the ones among the Fallen responsible for creating their species food!
Killing him will hurt their supplies and weaken their troops.
* Door opens, after enemies and lots of shooting they find another door
Ghost: I can open this door, but I hear more Fallen coming, give me cover while I do my job
* More enemies spawn (miniboss?), after they are all dead
Ghost: Got it! Let's move
* After walking a bit
Ghost: The Fallen, you know why they have this name? It's because they were just like the humans!
The traveler, it used to help them, but they became too greedy and corrupt, so it left
The Fallen did not like this move, so they followed him here, and now they want its power back!
* After walking a bit, they find more enemies (miniboss?), they find a gate
Ghost: So, this is the Sepiks lair? I will open it.
* Door opens, boss encounters starts... after killing boss
Ghost: We did it! Commander Zavala, Sepiks Prime is no more.
Zavala: Good news, this will be a huge loss for the Fallen on Earth. Good job Guardian, I expect great things from you
Zavala out
Ghost: Hey, check it out, I think I see a gun over there
*Player unlocks machine gun
