1st tower visit
* Player and ghost spawn on the tower

* Player walks up to Zavala
Zavala: Oh, hello Guardian! I see you are fresh out of the grave. These are hard times indeed, let me explain.
A few centuries ago, humanity found the Traveler, an alien orb capable of unthinkable power and knowledge.
With its help, we terraformed dozens of worlds and achieved high level technology, it was a true Golden Age.
But the Traveler had its enemy, the Darkness, that followed him to our own home: Earth!
As last resort, the Traveler sacrificed itself to dispel the Darkness, entering a deep dormant state.
As its last breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts, capable of giving the power of the Light to those who are worth it.
As your first mission, I need you to attack a possible whereabouts of the mighty Sepiks Prime.
Your ghost will provide you intel and keep our communications up. Eyes up, guardian!
* Level ends and player is loaded to the second mission
