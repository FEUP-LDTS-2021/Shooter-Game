FATE
1st mission - Intro
* Player spawns with ghost floating in front of him
Ghost: You're alive! I spent months trying to find someone compatible.
????: ROOOAAAAARRRR!!!!!
Ghost: Hurry up, they are coming, we can't stay here.
* Ghost despawns
* Player follows the path until they find a door with an item close to it
* Ghost spawns
Ghost: Hey, check that gun while I try to open this door.
* Player unlocks auto rifle and the door opens, Ghost despawns they walk a bit more until they find some Fallen
Ghost: Well, you've met the Fallen. They aren't very happy to see you
* Player combats Fallen until they find another item
Ghost: Guardian, I think I see a shotgun over there!
 * Player unlocks shotgun, level continues (miniboss).
Ghost: I think you got them all, at least for now. I found a ship a few weeks ago, it's just up ahead!
* Level ends, player is taken to the tower.

1st tower visit
* Player and ghost spawn on the tower
Ghost: This is the tower, an overwatch for Earth's Last City. Look, it's Commander Zavala! Let's talk to him
* Player walks up to Zavala
Zavala: Oh, hello Guardian! I see you are fresh out of the grave. These are hard times indeed, let me explain.
A few centuries ago, humanity found the Traveler, an alien orb capable of unthinkable power and knowledge.
With its help, we terraformed dozens of worlds and achieved high level technology, it was a true Golden Age.
But the Traveler had its enemy, the Darkness, that followed him to our own home: Earth!
As last resort, the Traveler sacrificed itself to dispel the Darkness, entering a deep dormant state.
As its last breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts, capable of giving the power of the Light to those who are worth it.
As your first mission, I need you to attack a possible whereabouts of the mighty Sepiks Prime.
Your ghost will provide you intel and keep our communications up. Eyes up, guardian!
* Level ends and player is loaded to the second mission

2nd mission - Sepiks Prime
* Player spawns on Earth, there is a door in front of him, so he walks towards it
Ghost: So, Sepiks Prime is an Archon, these are the ones among the Fallen responsible for creating their species food!
Killing him will hurt their supplies and weaken their troops.
* Door opens, after enemies and lots of shooting they find another door
Ghost: I can open this door, but I hear more Fallen coming, give me cover while I do my job
* More enemies spawn (miniboss?), after they are all dead
Ghost: Got it! Let's move
* After walking a bit
Ghost: The Fallen, you know why they have this name? It's because they were just like the humans!
The traveler, it used to help them, but they became too greedy and corrupt, so it left
The Fallen did not like this move, so they followed him here, and now they want its power back!
* After walking a bit, they find more enemies (miniboss?), they find a gate
Ghost: So, this is the Sepiks lair? I will open it.
* Door opens, boss encounters starts... after killing boss
Ghost: We did it! Commander Zavala, Sepiks Prime is no more.
Zavala: Good news, this will be a huge loss for the Fallen on Earth. Good job Guardian, I expect great things from you
Zavala out
Ghost: Hey, check it out, I think I see a gun over there
* Player unlocks machine gun

3rd mission - S.A.B.E.R.
* Player spawns on Earth and receives a message from Zavala
Zavala: Guardian, the Fallen breached into a Rasputin's bunker. Rasputin is an AI created during the Golden Age to
protect the solar system. It controls satellites and space weapons of high destructive power. This cannot fall on
enemy hands.
Ghost: The bunker entrance is up ahead, let's go!
* Player enters the bunker and walk a bit until they find some enemies. After pew pew.
Ghost: We need to open these doors, but even I can't hack Rasputins systems, let me scan the room...
Got it, that thing is a cooling cell, if we destroy it the system will overheat and open the door for us
Gun: Pew pew
Rasputin: Chto delayesh'? YA unichtozhu tebya orbital'noy raketoy
Ghost: I think he is really mad at us
* Door opens, player goes to electrical room. It has two corridors and there are beams coming from both
Ghost: Well, I think we shouldn't have shot that thing, but I believe shooting that other thing and the end of the
corridor will shut down these electric bolts.
* After player shoots the thing, the door opens. Next room has 3 waves of enemies. After enemies die, door opens and
player goes to the boss room
Ghost. He is... he is trying to merge Rasputin's technology with his own body. We got to stop him!
* After boss battle, player picks up and unlocks handcannon
Ghost: Ghost to Zavala, the Fallen are defeated and Rasputin is safe
Zavala: That's another victory to humanity. I just hope one day this AI will consider us as allies.
Ghost: Hey, that gun you unlocked, its a handcannon, you can select it on your inventory to take your auto rifle's slot.
You can swap it back anytime you want.

4th mission - The hive
Zavala: Guardian, he received a distress call from a fellow lightbearer named Osiris, he is a veteran and was on a top
secret mission. We need you to rescue him
Ghost: Before I found you, I used to watch Osiris study the City enemies, it was him that told me to search for my
guardian here on Earth, he needs our help guardian.
* Player walks to a place with a closed door as a lot of Fallen (miniboss)
Ghost: That guy was strong, what is he doing defending such a worthless place? Anyway, let me open that door...
Wow, the Fallen put some good defenses on this system, they really want to lock us out of this place... Got it!
* Door opens, player goes inside
????: ROOOAAAAARRRR!!!!!
Ghost: What was that?
* A pack of thrall spawn and attack the guardian, after they are dead
Ghost: Those are Hive! But here on Earth? I understand now, the Fallen weren't trying to lock us out, they were trying
to lock them here
Osiris: Help! Please, help me!
Ghost: That's Osiris, we need to go
* Another room with Hive enemies pew pew pew
* Boss room
Ghost: That's Osiris!
* Player shoots the boss a little bit and it runs despawns
Ghost: That thing ran away, he had Osiris and some really strong energy signature.
Ghost: I am tracking his ship, he is... he is going to the Moon. We will stop him. He may have taken Osiris, but
he left that gun.
* Player unlocks Sniper Rifle

5th mission - Ominigul
Zavala: Welcome to the moon, guardian, I wish your first visit was in better terms but we need you right now.
We tracked that thing to this location, his name is Ominigul and he is aspiring to the throne of the Hive.
Ghost: We are rescuing Osiris, no matter what faces us.
* 2 rooms with enemies tbh no need to new mechanics here, just some pew pew
* Boss room, after we kill him
Osiris: Thank you guardian, you saved my live. Ominigul is dead but he delivered the artifact.
Ghost: What artifact?
Osiris: It's some sort of supercomputer, it's capable of running infinite simulations of reality. That means the Hive
would be able to predict the future and defeat the city.
Ghost: That can't be good... let's get out of here... wait, what it that?
* Player unlocks Scout Rifle


6th mission - Phogoth
Zavala: Heads up, Osiris just arrived at the tower, he is safe. About your artifact, our intel says it was brought
here, to be defended but a monstrosity called Phogoth.
Osiris: Phogoth is some sort of mutant created by the Hive, watch out for him
Ghost: Don't worry, the city depends on us, and we are going to do everything we can to save it
* Again, I have no idea about runs here, just pew pew and hack doors
* Boss room, after we kill it
Ghost: Phogoth is dead, I am analysing the arti... oh!
Osiris: What?
Ghost: The artifact... is not a supercomputer, it's a part of one! And apparently it's almost completed, it's being
assembled on a place called Vault of Glass
Osiris: I've heard that name before... I know where to find it
Zavala: Alright guardian let's move
Ghost: Is that... a weapon? Why all the bosses drop human weapons? It's almost like we are in some sort of game...
* Player unlocks Rocket Launcher

7th mission - Vault of Glass
Zavala: What is this place?
Osiris: It is a region where time behaves... differently
Ghost: we are heading in
* Conflux encounter, defend to blocks
* Oracles encounter, blinking oracles 5x
